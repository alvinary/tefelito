Please note there is Blender addon capable of animating rigged models already, which uses a more sophisticated monocular pose estimation model that is able to emulate 3D motion capture using Vibe or FrankMocap (the latter even achieves detailed hand pose captures).

Look it up at [Carlos Eduardo Barreto](https://github.com/carlosedubarreto/b3d_mocap_import)'s github.
