Please note there is a Blender addon capable of animating rigged models already, which uses more sophisticated monocular pose estimation models (Vibe and FrankMocap). FrankMocap even achieves accurate and detailed hand pose captures.

Look it up at [Carlos Eduardo Barreto](https://github.com/carlosedubarreto/b3d_mocap_import)'s github.
