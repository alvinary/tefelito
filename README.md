Please note there is already a Blender addon using a more sophisticated monocular pose estimation model that is able to emulate 3D motion capture using Vibe or FrankMocap, which achieves detailed hand pose captures.

Look it up at [Carlos Eduardo Barreto](https://github.com/carlosedubarreto/b3d_mocap_import)'s github.
