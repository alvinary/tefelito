[] Add readme
     [] Examples

[] Document each function properly

=> Make module structure more sensible
   - poses should be independent of where you get frames from
        [X] Pose.read_from_mp4()
        [] Pose.poses_from_list()
   - rendering should be on two separate modules (one for 2d with pyglet, the other for 3d with ursina)
   - there should be a utils module for getting frames from video with ffmpeg
   - bpy interface module

[] Ursina rendering with [17, 3] tensors (just for testing with mock vectors)
[] BPY model manipulaton (again, with mock data)
[X] ffmpeg util
[/] Decent pose class
[X] Decent tflite interface util

[] Make some default skelletons

=> Figure out how to find the five scalars
=> Figure out how to find z axis direction
    [] Greedy
    [] UI
       [] CLI
       [] GUI

=> Validate input paths properly to avoid code injections
    [] Is pathlib.Path.is_file() enough?

[] Docker image
