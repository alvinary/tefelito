=> Make module structure more sensible
   - poses should be independent of where you get frames from
   - rendering should be on two separate modules (one for 2d with pyglet, the other for 3d with ursina)
   - there should be a utils module for getting frames from video with ffmpeg
   - bpy interface module

[] Ursina rendering with [17, 3] tensors (just for testing with mock vectors)
[] BPY model manipulaton (again, with mock data)
[] ffmpeg util
[] Decent pose class
[] Decent tflite interface util

[] Make some default skelletons

=> Figure out how to find the five scalars
=> Figure out how to find z axis direction
    [] Greedy
    [] UI
       [] CLI
       [] GUI
